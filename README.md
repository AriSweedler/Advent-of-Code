# Advent of Code

It's not good enough to just solve these, there's gotta be a fun workflow while
doing it.

The `aoc` command is a shell library that lets you do stuff like "get input",
"open up the main file", or "submit answers" without having to use your browser.

    ./bin/aoc input
    ./bin/aoc code
    ./bin/aoc answer 1 00000

To make API requests, you will just have to set the `AOC_SESSION` environment
variable in the repo root's `.env` file, and you'll be good to go.
